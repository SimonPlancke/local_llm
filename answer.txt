The SportCompetition program has the following potential shortcomings:

1. Lack of input validation: The program does not perform any input validation checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the 
input data is not in the expected format or contains invalid values.

2. Magic numbers: The program contains several hard-coded "magic numbers" that are used in calculations and conditional statements. These 
numbers should be defined as constants or variables with descriptive names to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Code duplication: The program contains several instances of duplicate code, which could be refactored 
into reusable functions or methods to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of bugs.

4. Error handling: The program does not handle errors gracefully and could crash or produce unexpected results if an error occurs. Implementing proper 
error handling and logging mechanisms could help to identify and address errors more efficiently.

5. Scalability: The program is not designed to handle large datasets, which could impact its performance and efficiency. Implementing optimizations 
and best practices could improve its scalability and performance.

6. Testing: The program does not appear to have any testing implemented, which could lead to undetected bugs or errors. Implementing testing 
and validation checks could improve the reliability and robustness of the program.

7. Code documentation: The program lacks documentation, making it difficult to understand 
its purpose, functionality, and implementation. Adding comments and documentation could improve its readability and maintainability.

8. Code organization: The program could 
benefit from better organization and structure, such as breaking it down into smaller functions or modules, to make it easier to understand, maintain, 
and extend.'
